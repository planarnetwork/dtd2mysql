 *
 * Two places, because a spec is one of two things. Beside its source it is a
 * unit test of the file it is named after. In `test/` it is an end to end test
 * of the package as a whole - a golden feed, a public surface - which is named
 * for what it checks rather than for a file, and has no business sitting in
 * `src/` where it would be compiled and published.
 *
 * Anything spanning more than one package goes in the repository's own `tests/`.
