# GB transit tooling

Tools for:

 - DTD feeds download and storage (CIF timetable, the fares feed and the routeing guide) 
 - GTFS loading, merging and output
 - CIF to GTFS conversion
 - TransXchange to GTFS conversion

The repository also builds and publishes that GTFS feed nightly.

## The published feed

If you want the data rather than the tools, you do not need to run anything:

**[planarnetwork.github.io/gb-transit](https://planarnetwork.github.io/gb-transit/)** — the site,
with the coverage window, what the current feed was built from, and a page for each tool.

| | |
|---|---|
| [`gtfs.zip`](https://github.com/planarnetwork/dtd2mysql/releases/latest/download/gtfs.zip) | where a service calls |
| [`gtfs-passing-points.zip`](https://github.com/planarnetwork/dtd2mysql/releases/latest/download/gtfs-passing-points.zip) | and where it runs through without stopping |

Both are rebuilt every night by [`feed.yml`](.github/workflows/feed.yml) from the configuration in
[`gtfs.config.yaml`](gtfs.config.yaml), validated against a
[pinned baseline](.github/validator-baseline.json), and attached to a dated release. A build that
fails validation is not published.

The feed makes decisions a consumer cannot infer from the GTFS specification — identifiers, splits
and joins, service days, the columns it adds.
**[Using this data](https://planarnetwork.github.io/gb-transit/feeds/using-this-data/)** states
them. Its source is
[`apps/website/src/pages/feeds/using-this-data.mdx`](apps/website/src/pages/feeds/using-this-data.mdx).

## The tools

```
npm install -g dtd2mysql
dtd2mysql --timetable /path/to/RJTTFxxx.ZIP
dtd2mysql --gtfs-zip gtfs.zip
```

`cif2gtfs` builds the same feed — byte for byte — straight from the feed files with no database:

```
npm install -g cif2gtfs
cif2gtfs build --source RJTTF918.ZIP --out gtfs.zip
```

Two more tools build and combine feeds beyond the railway:

```
npm install -g transxchange2gtfs gtfsmerge
transxchange2gtfs bus-timetables.zip bus.zip
gtfsmerge gtfs.zip bus.zip gb.zip
```

`transxchange2gtfs` converts TransXChange, the format GB bus and coach timetables are published in,
and `gtfsmerge` merges feeds into one. The first conversion downloads the national NaPTAN dataset —
around 100 MB — to say where the stops are, and caches it; `--naptan <file>` reads a copy you
already have instead. They compose with the rail feed because all three identify a
stop by its ATCO code, so a merged feed knows that the bus stop outside a station is outside that
station — no `--stop-prefix`, no reconciliation.
[`tests`](tests/README.md) is what keeps that true.

Full command line documentation is in each app's README:
**[`apps/dtd2mysql`](apps/dtd2mysql/README.md)** for the importer,
**[`apps/cif2gtfs`](apps/cif2gtfs/README.md)** for the one-shot build,
**[`apps/transxchange2gtfs`](apps/transxchange2gtfs/README.md)** for the bus conversion,
**[`apps/gtfsmerge`](apps/gtfsmerge/README.md)** for the merge.

## Packages

This is a monorepo. The published CLI is one workspace among several, and every package has a
README describing what it is for and how to use it.

### Applications

| Package | Published as | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| [`apps/dtd2mysql`](apps/dtd2mysql/README.md) | `dtd2mysql` | Import the feeds into MySQL, and export GTFS from it |
| [`apps/cif2gtfs`](apps/cif2gtfs/README.md) | `cif2gtfs` | Build a GTFS feed straight from the feed files, no database |
| [`apps/transxchange2gtfs`](apps/transxchange2gtfs/README.md) | `transxchange2gtfs` | Convert TransXChange bus and coach timetables to GTFS |
| [`apps/gtfsmerge`](apps/gtfsmerge/README.md) | `gtfsmerge` | Merge GTFS feeds into one |
| [`apps/website`](apps/website/README.md) | — | The download page and the guide, deployed to GitHub Pages |

### Libraries

| Package | Published as | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| [`libs/gtfs-schema`](libs/gtfs-schema/README.md) | `@gb-transit/gtfs-schema` | The shape of a GTFS feed: one type per file, and the scalars they are written in |
| [`libs/feed-parser`](libs/feed-parser/README.md) | `@gb-transit/feed-parser` | Declarative fixed-width and CSV record parsing |
| [`libs/dtd-schema`](libs/dtd-schema/README.md) | `@gb-transit/dtd-schema` | Record layouts for the fares, timetable, routeing guide and NFM64 feeds |
| [`libs/dtd-source`](libs/dtd-source/README.md) | `@gb-transit/dtd-source` | SFTP download, feed sequencing, and a timetable source that reads the files directly |
| [`libs/gtfs`](libs/gtfs/README.md) | `@gb-transit/gtfs` | GTFS entities, the transit model, the transforms and the build |
| [`libs/gtfs-output`](libs/gtfs-output/README.md) | `@gb-transit/gtfs-output` | Writers: a directory of text files, or a zip |
| [`libs/gtfs-loader`](libs/gtfs-loader/README.md) | `@gb-transit/gtfs-loader` | The reader: a GTFS zip, stream or response, as a timetable or as its rows |
| [`libs/naptan`](libs/naptan/README.md) | `@gb-transit/naptan` | Download, cache and read the NaPTAN national stop dataset |
| [`libs/enrich-naptan`](libs/enrich-naptan/README.md) | `@gb-transit/enrich-naptan` | Station coordinates and names from NaPTAN |
| [`libs/extend-station-groups`](libs/extend-station-groups/README.md) | `@gb-transit/extend-station-groups` | Group stations as GTFS Fares v2 areas |

`libs/gtfs` carries two extension points, so a source of data this repository does not know about
can be added without changing the build: an `Enricher` writes fields on entities the timetable
produced, and an `Extension` contributes whole files. `enrich-naptan` and `extend-station-groups`
are the two implementations, and they are the worked examples.

`dtd2mysql` depends on the libraries the way any other consumer would, so a GTFS build reading from
something other than this tool's MySQL schema needs `@gb-transit/gtfs` rather than the CLI.

`gtfs-schema` and `gtfs-loader` publish both CommonJS and ESM, where everything else here publishes
CommonJS only. That is because `gtfs-loader` reads a feed in a browser - it is the only package here
with a consumer that is not node - and `gtfs-schema` is the vocabulary it shares with the rest.

Libraries never depend on an app. Each package builds to its own `dist/` and the workspaces resolve
to that output, so `yarn build` has to happen before anything runs; `tsc -b` walks the project
references and makes it incremental.


## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are very welcome. To get set up:

```
git clone git@github.com:planarnetwork/gb-transit
yarn install
yarn test
```

Node 26 to develop on, as [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc) pins it. What the packages themselves need is Node 22,
which is what CI runs alongside 26: Temporal comes from
[`temporal-polyfill`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/temporal-polyfill), which defers to the built-in
global wherever there is one, so both the polyfilled and the native path are exercised.

[`apps/cif2gtfs/fixtures/mini`](apps/cif2gtfs/fixtures/mini) holds a small slice of a real feed and
the GTFS it produces, committed as text. The test suite builds it and diffs, so a change in the
feed's behaviour shows up in review as a readable diff rather than as a hash that moved. To take a
change, run `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 yarn vitest run`, read the diff, and record why it moved in
[`BASELINE.md`](apps/cif2gtfs/fixtures/BASELINE.md) — CI requires an entry.

Anything that should reach a user needs a changeset: run `yarn changeset`, pick the bump type, and
commit the file it writes. A pull request with no changeset publishes nothing, which is the right
answer for documentation and CI changes.

Please write contributions in TypeScript and, if possible, add a test. There are three places one
can go, and which it is says what kind of test it is:

| | |
|---|---|
| `<package>/src/Foo.spec.ts` | A unit test of `Foo.ts`, beside it. Named for the file it covers. |
| `<package>/test/*.spec.ts` | End to end for one package — a golden feed, a public surface. Named for what it checks rather than for a file, and out of `src/` because it is not published. |
| [`tests/`](tests/README.md) | End to end across packages. The three producers run in sequence, and the validator over what they build. |
