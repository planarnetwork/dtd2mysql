/**
 * The built feed, indexed, and writable only through a recorded write.
 *
 * An enricher gets this rather than the arrays, for two reasons. It can find a
 * stop by its code without walking 3,783 of them, which matters when a source
 * has 400,000 rows to match against. And it cannot assign to a field: `set` is
 * the only way in, so every change has an author and a priority, and nothing
 * can quietly overwrite something better.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. An enricher adds detail to entities the DTD already
 * produced; it does not create trips or delete stops. A source that wants to do
 * that is not an enricher and should say so.
 *
 * It is also the `FeedView` an extension reads, which is the same feed seen
 * through a smaller hole: everything here that reads, and nothing that writes.
