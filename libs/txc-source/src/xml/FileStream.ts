 * and a dataset holds hundreds of them, so pushing them all in and letting the
 * stream buffer costs gigabytes: the whole dataset ends up in memory at once
 * because the parser downstream is slower than the loop. Each push waits for the
 * reader to take it, which is what keeps a national dataset inside a gigabyte.
