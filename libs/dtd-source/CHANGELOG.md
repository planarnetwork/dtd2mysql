# @gb-transit/dtd-source

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 0f6bf84: Add `--remove-passing-points`, which defaults to `true`, so the feed is unchanged by default.

  Half the CIF's intermediate location records are places a service runs through without stopping,
  and 892,000 of them are at a station the feed publishes. They have always been dropped at the source
  query, so the only calls with no pickup and no drop off in the feed were the 4,800 operational stops
  where a service stops but nobody boards.

  `--remove-passing-points=false`, `removePassingPoints: false` in a config, or
  `GTFS_REMOVE_PASSING_POINTS=0` keeps them, as calls with `pickup_type` and `drop_off_type` of `1`
  and the pass time as both the arrival and the departure. Over three months of the whole network that
  is 3.43 million stop times against 2.84 million. Trips, routes and calendars are identical;
  `stops.txt` gains 59 stops. A passing point names its platform like any other call, falling back to
  the station where the pass record gives none: 89% of passing calls land on a boarding point the feed
  already publishes because something stops there, so the id a passing call carries is the one a
  stopping call at that platform carries.

  Fixes a bug it uncovered: where two of a service's timing points share a CRS, the one that boards or
  alights wins, but a request stop has `pickup_type` 3 rather than 0 and so had nothing to win with. 28
  of them were displaced by the point the service passes on the way in.

  The nightly workflow now publishes both feeds, `gtfs.zip` and `gtfs-passing-points.zip`, each gated
  by its own validator baseline.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- Realign the published version with the registry.

  `yarn release` published every workspace whether or not its version had moved, so a
  package with nothing to say failed the run on "cannot publish over the previously
  published versions" and took the packages that did have something to say down with it.
  Five releases died that way, from 2 September on: the registry stayed where it was while
  master went on bumping numbers that nobody could install.

  Those numbers are abandoned rather than published. Every `@gb-transit` package is
  released here at 1.0.0 - a major, because the last version installable from npm is
  0.2.0 and this is not what that number promises.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 1d05d5b: Put the fixed links where GTFS expects them, say what the feed covers, and check it.

  **Major, because every identifier in the feed changes.** A consumer joining on a
  three letter `stop_id` or a bare ATOC `agency_id` has to move to `stop_code` and
  the NOC form, and there is no flag to keep the old ones - see below.

  - **`links.txt` is now `transfers.txt`.** The fixed links were in a file of this
    project's own invention that no consumer reads. They are transfers with a
    minimum time, merged with the station interchange rows. GTFS has nowhere to
    put a time window or a mode in a standard field, so they are producer
    extension columns, and 8,514 records become 2,406 rows because the stop pair
    is the primary key - the shortest wins, and the modes and window are the
    envelope of the records that describe the pair. `--links` still writes the old
    file for one release.
  - **`feed_info.txt` is written**, with the publisher, the language, the source
    feed as `feed_version`, and the window the feed can actually be trusted for.
  - **CI runs the MobilityData validator** over the mini fixture and fails on any
    error. The accepted warnings are committed with a reason each, so a new one
    fails the build and a fixed one has to be taken off the list.
  - **The feed no longer points at stops it does not declare.** 36 calls named
    `QHA` and `ZUX`, which appear in the z-train stop times and nowhere else in
    the feed - no name, no coordinate, nothing to publish a stop from. The calls
    are dropped and counted; the 31 trips that had nothing left are dropped with
    them.
  - **The CLI exits when it is finished.** The download commands left a database
    pool open, so the process hung after the transfer completed - harmless at a
    prompt, fatal for a scheduled job.
  - **Platforms are stops, and the stops are the ones the rest of the country
    uses.** A station is a `location_type=1` stop with a child per place a train
    calls, which is the structure the GTFS best practices describe, and both are
    identified by their NaPTAN ATCO code: `910GCLPHMJC` for Clapham Junction, with
    `9100CLPHMJC15`, `9100CLPHMJW3` and `9100CLPHMJM11` beneath it. A call that
    names no platform points at `9100` and the TIPLOC of the timing point.
    **`stop_id` is no longer a CRS code, so this breaks any consumer joining on
    one - the CRS is now `stop_code`**, on the station and on every stop beneath
    it. `transfers.txt` references stations. The ids are a function of the TIPLOC
    the timetable already carries, so nothing external is needed to produce them,
    and a feed in them can be merged with the DfT's bus and metro data as it is.
  - **`agency_id` is the National Operator Catalogue code**: `=SN`, `=AW`, `=GW`.
    A bare two letter code is an airline in the NOC - `BA` is British Airways -
    and rail operators are distinguished by the equals sign.
  - **An incremental's stop times and z-trains reach the database.** Records that
    generate their own id counted from zero on every import, and since `id` is the
    primary key, `INSERT IGNORE` silently dropped every row an earlier feed had
    already numbered - so an incremental's schedules landed and their stop times
    did not. Every counter is now continued from the table, not just the one for
    schedules.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 0f61a32: Split the tool into a monorepo.

  `dtd2mysql` is now assembled from five `@gb-transit` packages rather than one flat tree,
  and they are published in their own right: a GTFS build that reads from somewhere other
  than this tool's MySQL schema can depend on `@gb-transit/gtfs` without the CLI.

  **The command line is unchanged.** Same flags, same environment variables, same GTFS
  output - verified byte-identical against the same database before and after the move. If
  you install `dtd2mysql` to run it, nothing about this release asks anything of you.

  **The package layout is not**, which is why this is a major. Anything importing from the
  package rather than running it has to move:

  - `dtd2mysql/dist/src/...` and `dtd2mysql/dist/config/...` no longer exist. That code is
    in the `@gb-transit` package that now owns it - record layouts in `dtd-schema`, the
    parser in `feed-parser`, the GTFS model, transforms and build in `gtfs`, the writers in
    `gtfs-output`, SFTP and feed sequencing in `dtd-source`.
  - `files` is `dist` and `bin`. `main` and `types` resolve to `dist/index.js` and
    `dist/index.d.ts`, which is where they are emitted - `main` previously named a path that
    the `files` list did not ship, so `require("dtd2mysql")` never worked.
