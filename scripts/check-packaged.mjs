/**
 * Install what would be published, and use it.
 *
 * The tests run against source, so `main`, `types`, `bin`, `exports` and `files`
 * breakage is invisible to them: a package can pass every spec and still ship a
 * tarball that cannot be required. This packs every workspace, installs each
 * published thing into a directory of its own, and then does something real with
 * it - builds a fixture, reads a feed, runs a command.
 *
 * The `@gb-transit` dependencies resolve to the tarballs packed here rather than
 * to the registry, so this checks the commit rather than the last release, and
 * works before a package has ever been published.
 *
 * Each install gets its own directory. Two CLIs share every dependency, so
 * resolving one from the other's tree would quietly pass whatever this one's
 * tarball left out.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-packaged.mjs [directory]
 *
 * With no directory it uses a temporary one and removes it afterwards, which is
 * what makes this runnable locally rather than only on a runner.
