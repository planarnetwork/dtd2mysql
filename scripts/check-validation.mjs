/**
 * Hold the validator report to .github/validator-baseline.json.
 *
 * "Any ERROR stops the release" cannot be the rule, because two of them are
 * decisions: B10 publishes an unlocated stop at 0,0 so that a validator flags
 * it, and B24/B25 are closed as source data the feed reports rather than
 * corrects. A gate that can never pass is a gate somebody turns off.
 *
 * So the baseline names the errors that are accepted and how many of each. An
 * unlisted code fails, and so does a listed one that grew - an accepted error
 * is a known quantity, not a licence for more of the same. Fewer than the
 * baseline allows is reported rather than accepted silently, because that is
 * the moment to tighten it.
 *
 * Usage: check-validation.mjs [REPORT] [BASELINE] [OUT]
 *
 * The nightly builds the feed twice - once without the locations a service
 * passes through and once with them - and each gets its own baseline. One
 * baseline for both would mean accepting whatever the passing points introduce
 * for the feed that does not have them, which is not a gate.
