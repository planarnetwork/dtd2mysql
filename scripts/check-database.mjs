/**
 * The importer, against a real database.
 *
 * Nothing in the unit tests can run without one, so every claim about the
 * importer was checked by hand until this existed. It needs a MariaDB, which is
 * why it is its own CI job and why it is a script rather than a spec.
 *
 *   DATABASE_HOSTNAME=127.0.0.1 DATABASE_USERNAME=root DATABASE_NAME=dtd2mysql_test \
 *     node scripts/check-database.mjs [directory]
 *
 * Three things, in order:
 *
 *   The mini fixture is a real DTD zip, so importing it exercises the whole
 *   parse-and-insert path - the fixed width records, the generated ids, the DDL.
 *
 *   The same feed comes out whichever way the timetable was read. That is the
 *   whole point of having two sources, and no unit test can check it: one side
 *   needs a database and the other exists so it does not.
 *
 *   Importing twice lands the same rows. Records that generate their own id are
 *   the risk, and a collision only shows on the second import.
