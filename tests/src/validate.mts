 * that are either out of our hands or waiting on a ticket - but the set of them
 * is committed, so a new one fails and a fixed one has to be taken off the list.
 * A baseline nobody prunes stops meaning anything.
 *
 * The merged feed is the one worth having here. The other two are checked by
 * their own golden tests; the merge renumbers every service, route and trip id
 * across two feeds, and a dangling reference from that is exactly what a
 * hand-written fixture cannot produce and a validator can see.
