# Baseline changes

Every change to a committed baseline is recorded here, with the reason and the ticket. CI fails a
commit that touches one without an entry.

The baselines capture *current* behaviour, defects included. That is the point: rebaselining is the
normal path for a correctness fix, and the diff is the evidence the fix did what it claimed. The
requirement is that it is deliberate and explained, not that it is rare.

Add an entry to the top. `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 yarn vitest run apps/dtd2gtfs` regenerates the mini
golden; `UPDATE_SURFACE=1 yarn vitest run libs/gtfs` regenerates the type surface. **Read the diff
before committing it** - that is the whole value of the file being text.

## B23 · platforms as child stops

`stops.txt` gains 124 rows in the fixture: 82 stations become `location_type=1` and each gains a
child per platform called at. `stop_times.stop_id` points at the platform. Nothing else moves.

## B10, B11, B12 · places that do not exist

`stops.txt` loses the `XAG` CIE station, which has an all-zero coordinate and nothing calling at it,
and the `QXD`/`QXO` operator placeholders. `transfers.txt` loses their three self-transfer rows.
`routes.txt` loses the XC placeholder route and renumbers the two after it. `trips.txt` loses the
two trips that called only at placeholders.

## B1, B2 · transfers and feed_info

`links.txt` is gone by default and its rows are in `transfers.txt` with the mode, window and days as
extension columns. `feed_info.txt` is new.

## B15 · stops the feed does not declare

No change to the fixture, which has no dangling calls. Recorded so the absence is deliberate.

## Reading publishes its junction rather than its station

`stops.txt`: `RDG` gains `stop_code` `RDNGSTN` in place of `RDNGORJ`, and `stop_desc` 2 in place of
9. A CRS can have several TIPLOCs and whichever arrived first used to win; a
`cate_interchange_status` of 9 marks a subsidiary location, so the station is now preferred over the
junction sharing its code. 75 stations change on the full feed, one in the fixture.

## B4, B7, B8, B9, B13 · things that are not true

`trips.txt` gains real headsigns and loses the `wheelchair_accessible=1` claim. `stop_times.txt`
loses the platform from `stop_headsign`. `stops.txt` loses the MSN header record, stop `4/0`.
