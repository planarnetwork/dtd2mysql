# dtd2gtfs

Build a GTFS feed from the British rail DTD timetable feed. No database, one command.

```
dtd2gtfs build --source RJTTF918.ZIP --out gtfs.zip
```

Not published yet. From a clone:

```
yarn workspace dtd2gtfs run start build --source RJTTF918.ZIP --out gtfs.zip
```

## Requirements

Node.js 26 or later. Date handling uses the built-in `Temporal` API, which is only available as a
global from Node 26 onwards.

## Usage

```
dtd2gtfs build [OPTIONS]

  --source PATH        a DTD timetable zip, or a directory of them. Repeat it to
                       combine sources
  --out PATH           where to write. A path ending .zip produces a zip, anything
                       else a directory of text files (defaults to ./gtfs.zip)
  --range RANGE        how far ahead to build, e.g. "3 months" (defaults to '3 MONTH')
  --today YYYY-MM-DD   the date to build for (defaults to the current date)
  --remove-passing-points BOOL
                       whether to drop the locations a service runs through
                       without stopping (defaults to true)
```

The DTD feed is published as a weekly full refresh followed by daily incrementals. Pass them in the
order they were published and the result is the same as importing them in that order:

```
dtd2gtfs build \
  --source RJTTF918.ZIP \
  --source RJTTC919.ZIP \
  --source RJTTC920.ZIP \
  --out gtfs.zip --range "6 months"
```

Or point it at the directory you download into and let it work that out:

```
dtd2gtfs build --source ./feeds --out gtfs.zip --range "6 months"
```

A directory contributes every `RJTTFxxx.ZIP` and `RJTTCxxx.ZIP` it holds, ordered by sequence
number and starting at the most recent full refresh — anything before that refresh is superseded
by it. The fares, routeing and NFM64 feeds are ignored, so a directory holding all four is fine.

Note that this is not the same as sorting by filename: as text every `RJTTC` sorts before every
`RJTTF`, which would put the refresh after the incrementals that amend it.

`--today` exists so a build can be reproduced. Without it the feed is a function of the day it ran
and cannot be compared to yesterday's.

`GTFS_RANGE` and `GTFS_TODAY` are read as well, for compatibility with `dtd2mysql`; `--range` and
`--today` override them. `GTFS_REMOVE_PASSING_POINTS` does the same for `--remove-passing-points`.

## Passing points

Half the CIF's intermediate location records are places a service runs through without stopping,
and 892,000 of them are at a station the feed publishes. They are not calls: nobody boards and
nobody alights. By default they are dropped.

`--remove-passing-points=false` keeps them, as calls with `pickup_type` and `drop_off_type` of `1`
and the pass time as both the arrival and the departure. Over three months of the whole network
that is 3.46 million stop times against 2.85 million, of which 613,000 are passed rather than
called at. The trips, routes and calendars are identical either way; `stops.txt` gains 59 stops.

A passing point names its platform like any other call, and falls back to the station where the
pass record gives none. The platform a train runs through is a real platform: 89% of passing calls
land on a boarding point the feed already publishes because something stops there, so the id a
passing call carries is the one a stopping call at that platform carries. The 05:00 Victoria to
Gatwick passes Clapham Junction platform 15 as `9100CLPHMJC15` — the same stop 1,857 boardable
calls use.

The 12 stops that are new are real platforms this window has no calls at: Pilning 2, New Cross Gate
3 and 4, Wembley Central 3 and 4, Clapham Junction Main 8, Finsbury Park 3, Grove Park 2, New
Barnet 2, Rotherham Central 4T, and Wixams 1 and 2.

One caveat if you use both feeds: a call publishes its public time and a passing point has only its
working time, and the CIF's two clocks do not always agree. In 27 places out of 3.46 million a pass
reads as later than the call after it.

## Getting the feed

The timetable feed comes from the DTD SFTP server. `dtd2mysql --download-timetable` will fetch it,
or take it from wherever you already keep it.

## What it produces

`agency.txt`, `stops.txt`, `transfers.txt`, `links.txt`, `routes.txt`, `trips.txt`, `stop_times.txt`,
`calendar.txt` and `calendar_dates.txt`. Output is byte-identical to what `dtd2mysql --gtfs`
produces from the same feed files, and the same input and `--today` always produce the same bytes.

A build that finds no schedules in the window fails rather than writing an empty feed.

Building three months of the whole GB network takes around 45 seconds and 5 GB of memory.
