/**
 * Merge sorted, duplicate-free sequences into one, still sorted and still duplicate-free.
 *
 * Each shard has already been through `TransferPatternMerge`, which sorts a bucket with
 * `[...set].sort()` - a plain lexicographic sort of the whole line. So the order here has to be
 * that same order, and the comparison below is `<` on the joined codes rather than anything
 * cleverer. Get it wrong and `frontCode` still writes a file: one that decodes into patterns
 * nobody ever found, rather than one that fails. Hence the tests.
 *
 * Linear in the output and holding one pattern per shard, rather than the deal-into-buckets and
 * sort-each that produced the shards. That matters because this is the one stage that cannot be
 * sharded: it is the last thing the nightly does and the whole file goes through it.
