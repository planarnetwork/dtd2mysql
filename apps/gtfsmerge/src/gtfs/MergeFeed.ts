/**
 * The files a merge writes, and the columns of each.
 *
 * Where every column a file has is written, the schema's own list is referenced
 * rather than respelled. What is spelled out below is what this tool decided,
 * and two of those decisions are wider than what gtfsmerge used to write, both
 * for the sake of merging a feed from this repository:
 *
 * `platform_code` on a stop, because that is how the rail feed says which
 * platform a boarding point is, and a merge that dropped it would quietly throw
 * that away.
 *
 * `from_trip_id` and `to_trip_id` on a transfer, because a transfer_type 4 is a
 * coupling between two named trips and without them the row means nothing. They
 * are remapped along with everything else - see StopsAndTransfersMerger.
