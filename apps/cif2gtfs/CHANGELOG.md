## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- f9a4260: Leave the services National Rail does not run out of a feed, when a config asks.

  The CIF is the National Rail timetable and it carries services National Rail does not hold
  authority over: the tube, the Tyne & Wear Metro, the ferries and the scheduled buses. A feed
  combined with other sources has better answers for those elsewhere — TfL names the NaPTAN stop a
  replacement bus calls at and the letter route code it runs under, neither of which the CIF has — so
  publishing them here describes the same journey worse.

  A build config can now say what to leave out:

  ```yaml
  exclude:
    modes: [metro, bus, ship] # replacement buses are their own mode and stay
    operators: [ES, LT, TW, ZZ] # everything they run, replacement buses included
    replacementBuses: [LO, XR] # only their replacement buses; the trains stay
  ```

  Three lists rather than one switch, because they are three questions. The operators are a blacklist
  so that a National Rail operator this build has never heard of is published rather than silently
  dropped, and the mode rule cannot say what the operator rule does: a London Underground replacement
  bus is a replacement bus, and TfL is the one publishing it. Every list is empty unless a config says
  otherwise, so a build that says nothing about this produces the feed it always did.

  Config only. Everything else a build decides is a single value that a flag or an environment
  variable could also say; these are three lists of codes.

  `@gb-transit/gtfs` gains `excludeServices`, `ServiceExclusions`, `NO_EXCLUSIONS` and `MODES`, and
  `BuildContext` an optional `exclude`. The schedules are dropped after the overlays are applied, so a
  train replaced on some days by a service the rules exclude does not come back on those days, and
  before the associations, so a portion is not cut into coupled and uncoupled days for a base that is
  then excluded.

  The nightly publishes a third feed, `gtfs-national-rail-only.zip`, built from
  `gtfs.national-rail-only.config.yaml` with all three rules on. `gtfs.zip` and
  `gtfs-passing-points.zip` are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 4941620: Lower the engine floor from Node 26 to Node 22, with Temporal from `temporal-polyfill`.

  Node 26 was required for one reason: it is the first release to expose `Temporal` as a global,
  and the calendar is written against it. That put every package on a runtime that will not be LTS
  until October, for an API the rest of the code does not care about the provenance of.

  `temporal-polyfill` provides it, and hands over to the built-in global wherever there is one, so
  Node 26 runs exactly the implementation it ran before — the import resolves to the same object.
  Where `Temporal` was reached as a global it is now imported, which is the whole of the change to
  the date handling: the polyfill exports it as a namespace, so the declarations still read
  `Temporal.PlainDate`, and the pinned type surface has not moved.

  CI runs 22 and 26 rather than 26 alone. `lib` drops from `esnext` to `es2024` so that an API the
  floor does not have cannot be typed as though it did — which is also what proves the global is
  gone, since a missed call site no longer compiles.

  One thing was genuinely broken below Node 24 rather than merely unavailable. `FeedZip` reports
  the file and the line a CIF record failed to parse on by throwing from a `data` listener, and an
  error thrown there only reaches `finished()` from Node 24 onwards; on 22 it escaped as an uncaught
  exception and the stream never settled. It destroys the stream with that error instead, which
  reports the same thing on every version.

### Major Changes

- 610f8ef: Absorb gtfsmerge and transxchange2gtfs, and give every producer one schema

  The GTFS schema was written down four times across three repositories, in
  three incompatible ways, and only one of them type checked. It is now written
  once, in `@gb-transit/gtfs-schema`, and a producer declares which columns of
  which file it writes.

  **`@gb-transit/gtfs-schema`** — `GTFSOutput` moves here from `@gb-transit/gtfs`,
  which re-exports it. New `Columns`, `FileSchema` and `fileSchema`, and a new
  `Shape`/`ShapeRow`. `StopTime.stop_headsign` was typed `null` and is now
  `string | null` — `Headsigns.ts` already put a string there through
  `Object.assign`, so this is a correction. `Trip` gains optional `block_id` and
  `shape_id` and its `service_id` accepts a string; `StopRow` loosens
  `location_type`, `zone_id`, `stop_code`, `stop_desc` and `stop_url`, and its
  coordinates accept text so a value that arrived as `51.50740` does not
  re-serialise a digit short; `Transfer`'s twelve producer extensions and its two
  trip ids become optional; `RouteType` gains `Air`.

  **`@gb-transit/gtfs` and `@gb-transit/gtfs-output`** — `GTFSOutput.open` takes
  the columns and returns a `RowWriter<R>` rather than a `Writable`, and
  `extensionFile` takes columns. `csv-write-stream` is replaced by `CSVRowWriter`, which
  writes the header when the file is opened - so a file with no rows is an empty
  table rather than an empty file. Its escaping is a transcription of
  csv-write-stream's rule rather than a differential result: the committed goldens
  are unchanged, and the cases they do not reach are written down in
  `CSVRowWriter.spec.ts`.
  `writeZip` is exported so all three tools share one deterministic archiver.

  **`@gb-transit/gtfs-loader`** gains `readFeed` and `readFeedRows`: the same feed
  read as the rows it was written as, every file and every column, for a tool that
  rewrites a feed rather than plans over one. Built from the parts `loadGTFS`
  already used.
  **`@gb-transit/naptan`** is new: the NaPTAN download, cache and CSV read, with
  no other dependency, so a bus converter does not inherit a rail transit model to
  get them.

  **`cif2gtfs` and `dtd2mysql`** — the SPI change, and `cif2gtfs`'s `main` points
  at `dist/api.js` so requiring the package no longer runs a build.

  **`transxchange2gtfs`** — behaviour is the same except: a file with no rows now
  has a header rather than being empty; a value containing a newline is quoted;
  an absent value is empty rather than the text `undefined`; NaPTAN is read by
  column name from the current DfT endpoint rather than by slicing the national
  CSV at fixed positions, and `--naptan <file>` reads it from disk; the zip is
  written in process, so `zip` is no longer required on PATH; and
  `bin/transxchange2gtfs.sh` required a path the build never produced, so the
  published CLI could not have run at all.

  **`gtfsmerge`** — behaviour is the same except for five fixes, each written up
  in `apps/gtfsmerge/fixtures/BASELINE.md`. Generated walk transfer distances were
  wrong twice over: the ruler was calibrated at 46°N, central France, and the
  coordinates were passed to it as `[latitude, longitude]` where it takes
  `[longitude, latitude]` — together about 70% too long. `--no-date-filter`
  dropped every calendar in every feed rather than keeping them. Transfers to a
  stop nothing calls at were written, leaving dangling references. A call moved
  from a platform onto its station left the station as `location_type` 1, which
  GTFS forbids for a stop something calls at. `transfers.txt` now carries
  `from_trip_id` and `to_trip_id` and renumbers them, so a coupling survives the
  merge, and `stops.txt` carries `platform_code`. `--ruler-latitude` and
  `--date-filter` are new, `zip` is no longer required on PATH, and `main` points
  at `dist/api.js`.

### Patch Changes

- c696f32: Keep the trains that run in the repeated hour of the autumn clock change on the day they run.

  On the last Sunday of October 01:00 to 01:59 happens twice, once in BST and again in GMT.
  `shiftLateNightServices` moves anything departing before 02:00 onto the previous service day, which
  reads every such departure as the first pass. That is right for a service day that ends before the
  change, and wrong for one that runs through it: an 01:05 GMT departure is 26:05 of the Saturday
  service day, and telling it as 25:05 puts it alongside the train that already ran an hour earlier.

  The London Overground Windrush line is the only service in Great Britain that runs through the
  change, and it covers the repeated hour with new short term plan schedules dated to that Sunday
  alone - four in each direction between Highbury & Islington and New Cross Gate. A schedule of that
  shape - operator `LO`, on the Windrush line, a new schedule rather than an overlay, departing
  between 01:00 and 01:59, and whose own record is dated to the last Sunday of October and nothing
  else - is now left where that record puts it. The standard schedules cover the first pass and are
  shifted as before, as is an overlay on that Sunday, which is how the departure already in the
  timetable gets retimed. The count is logged when it is not zero, because the rule is expected to
  stop matching if the operator changes how it publishes these.

  `Association.apply` now asks whether the shift will move the schedule of `asDated` rather than of
  `assoc`. `asDated` is the one that reaches the shift, and it carries the calendar `coupled` has just
  narrowed, which is what the answer now depends on.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- First published release. `npm install -g cif2gtfs`.

  The package was private while there was no published feed to point people at. There is one now, so
  it goes to npm alongside the `@gb-transit` libraries it was held back with. No behaviour changes:
  the CLI, its flags and the feed it produces are what 0.1.0 built, and the mini fixture's golden is
  untouched.

  It now declares `main`, `types` and a `files` list of `dist` and `bin`, so the tarball is the built
  output rather than the working directory.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 783c178: Publish an overnight associated schedule once, on the day its own record dates it.

  A schedule that runs the day after its base was published twice: once told in the base's service
  day, at times past 24:00, and once on the day its own record gives. Both are the same train, so a
  departure board built from the feed showed it leaving twice, and the copy told in the base's day was
  the one a coupling named. Over three months of the whole network that is 108 trips and 1,057 stop
  times, measured against RJTTF847/918; the mini fixture goes from 150 trips and 1,590 stop times to
  128 and 1,326.

  The associated schedule now stays where its own record puts it and the transfer names it there.
  GTFS does not ask the two trips a coupling names to run on one service day - a transfer carries no
  calendar, and `to_trip_id` is defined against the stop rather than the start of the trip - so a
  coupling that happens over midnight is now read as one, and the Aberdeen portion of the sleeper is
  the Tuesday 04:28 out of Edinburgh rather than a Monday 28:28.

  **Breaking for consumers whose planner cannot follow a transfer across a service day.**
  `--duplicate-overnight-associations`, `duplicateOvernightAssociations: true` in a config, or
  `GTFS_DUPLICATE_OVERNIGHT_ASSOCIATIONS=1` publishes the copy as well and points the coupling at it,
  which is the previous behaviour. It is off by default, and a feed built with it carries the same
  train twice on purpose.

  **Breaking for `@gb-transit/gtfs`.** `applyAssociations` and `Association.apply` take the setting as
  a further argument. `AssociationApplication` replaces `associated`/`asDated` with `asDated`,
  `duplicated` and `unassociated`, which say which of the three copies each one is rather than leaving
  two of them to overlap. `addLateNightServices` is now `shiftLateNightServices`, and no longer takes
  an `IdGenerator`: it replaces each schedule with the shifted copy, which keeps the id it was given.
  `Schedule.copyToPreviousServiceDay` is the one implementation of the day shift both it and an
  overnight duplicate use.

- 0f6bf84: Add `--remove-passing-points`, which defaults to `true`, so the feed is unchanged by default.

  Half the CIF's intermediate location records are places a service runs through without stopping,
  and 892,000 of them are at a station the feed publishes. They have always been dropped at the source
  query, so the only calls with no pickup and no drop off in the feed were the 4,800 operational stops
  where a service stops but nobody boards.

  `--remove-passing-points=false`, `removePassingPoints: false` in a config, or
  `GTFS_REMOVE_PASSING_POINTS=0` keeps them, as calls with `pickup_type` and `drop_off_type` of `1`
  and the pass time as both the arrival and the departure. Over three months of the whole network that
  is 3.43 million stop times against 2.84 million. Trips, routes and calendars are identical;
  `stops.txt` gains 59 stops. A passing point names its platform like any other call, falling back to
  the station where the pass record gives none: 89% of passing calls land on a boarding point the feed
  already publishes because something stops there, so the id a passing call carries is the one a
  stopping call at that platform carries.

  Fixes a bug it uncovered: where two of a service's timing points share a CRS, the one that boards or
  alights wins, but a request stop has `pickup_type` 3 rather than 0 and so had nothing to win with. 28
  of them were displaced by the point the service passes on the way in.

  The nightly workflow now publishes both feeds, `gtfs.zip` and `gtfs-passing-points.zip`, each gated
  by its own validator baseline.
