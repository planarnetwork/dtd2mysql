/**
 * The three tools, in sequence, over the fixtures they each commit.
 *
 *   cif2gtfs           the mini DTD timetable  ->  a rail feed
 *   transxchange2gtfs  the mini TransXChange   ->  a bus feed
 *   gtfsmerge          both of those           ->  one feed
 *   gtfs-read          the merged feed         ->  these assertions
 *
 * This is the only test that can exist here rather than in one of the three
 * projects, and it is the reason they are in one repository. Each of them has
 * its own golden; what this checks is that their output composes - that a rail
 * feed and a bus feed built from the same shared schema can be merged into
 * something a consumer can use.
 *
 * The bus fixture is an Amersham service because Amersham is a station the DTD
 * mini fixture actually serves, and a bus stop outside a served station is what
 * makes the last assertion here possible. Bristol Temple Meads was the first
 * choice and is in the rail feed - but only because a fixed link reaches it, not
 * because any train in the fixture calls there, so the merge drops it.
